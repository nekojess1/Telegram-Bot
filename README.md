# How to make a bot for telegram :iphone: ðŸ¤–

### First you need to create an account on [DialogFlow](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiG94b-nJrlAhWWH7kGHfn1BfsQFjAAegQICBAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdialogflow.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw3iZls3qgojxCPzBzYjQwrV).

### Now you have to talk with the @botFather on Telegram to create your bot and to get your token.

### Once this is done, go to the dialog flow to build the conversation interface of your bot.

### __Now, follow these steps:__

* Click on "Create a new agent". 
* Fill in the requested data and click in the "Create" button. 
A screen similar to this should now appear. This is where all the "magic" will happen for your bot to work.

* Click on "Integrations" in the side menu. There will appear several applications that dialog flow can do integration.
* Click on the switch telegram. A box will appear where you will add the token acquired at the beginning of the tutorial.

### Added the token, click "start".

### Now you can close the box. Your agent is ready to work on the Telegram.

### __But we don't teach him anything, so it will only work with the intents already created by Dialogflow.__

## __For create the intents, follow this steps:__
1. Click in "Intents" in the side menu. 
2. Click in Create new intents. 

### By creating an intent, you can train your bot to perform actions. In the photo below, my bot will answer a certain answer when someone asks something about Ohm's first law. I added more than one sentence to make it smarter. Being able to identify several forms of the same question.

### Create an intent for each action your bot takes, giving more and more training to your bot.
